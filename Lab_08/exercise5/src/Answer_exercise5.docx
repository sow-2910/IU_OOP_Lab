a) This design violates the Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) since high level module(CheckoutService) is depend on the low-level module(PaypalPayment). As a result, when we want to add another payment methods, we will need to open class CheckoutService and rewrite the code which is currently working well.
f) This design respect DependencyInversion Principle(DIP) since high level module(CheckoutService) is no longer depend on low-level PaypalPayment. Instead both of them rely on Abstraction which is interface PaymentMethod
