This Java package, `question1`, is designed for representing and manipulating **2D points** using the `Point2D` class. The `Point2D` class encapsulates an **x and y coordinate** and includes constructors for default initialization, explicit coordinate setting, and copy creation. It provides methods like `input()` to allow user modification, `isOrigin()` to check if the point is at $(0,0)$, and a `toString()` method for easy printing. Crucially, it offers both an **instance method** and a **static method** for calculating the Euclidean **distance** between two points. The `TestingPoint2D` class serves as a driver to demonstrate these functionalities, creating, modifying, and calculating distances for several Point2D objects.
