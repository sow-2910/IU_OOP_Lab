a) Penguin is a problem for LSP since the sub class is not substituable for the super class.
b) A better design is that we should divide class Penguin into 2 different class, one class can name FlyingBird and the other class can be SwimmingBird, by this we can have the clas Penguin extends SwimmingBird
